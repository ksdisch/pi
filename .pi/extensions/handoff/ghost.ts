 * The handoff note the reader ingested carries `session_file` — the predecessor's full
 * JSONL transcript. That session is gone, but everything it knew is in the file, so a
 * one-shot LLM call over transcript + question resurrects it well enough to answer
 * "why did you rule that approach out?" long after it quit. No coordination, no
 * timing: this works whether the predecessor died seconds or days ago. (When both
 * sessions are alive at once, the sibling `intercom` extension is the live channel.)
 *
 * Like `compose.ts`, every pi import is type-only, which keeps this module
 * unit-testable without pulling pi's runtime module graph into the test process. The
 * JSONL parse is deliberately reimplemented here (12 lines, same skip-malformed-lines
 * semantics as pi's `parseSessionEntries`) rather than imported for the same reason.
