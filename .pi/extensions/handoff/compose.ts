Output Markdown with exactly these three sections, in this order:

## Context
What we were doing and why. Decisions made and the reasoning behind them, approaches ruled out, and anything discovered the hard way. Be specific: name files, functions, commands, and error messages.

## Next steps
The concrete task the next session should pick up, stated so it can act without asking questions.

## Files touched
A bullet list of the files read and the files modified, with a few words on what changed in each.

Rules:
- No preamble, no closing remarks, no code fences around the whole note. Start with "## Context".
- Prefer concrete detail over summary. The next session cannot ask you follow-up questions.
- Do not invent work that did not happen. If a section has nothing to report, say so in one line.`;
